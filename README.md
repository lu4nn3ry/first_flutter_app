# first-flutter-app
 Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.  In this codelab, you'll create a simple mobile Flutter app. If you're familiar with object-oriented code and basic programming concepts—such as variables, loops, and conditionals—then you can complete the codelab. You don't need previous experience with Dart, mobile, desktop, or web programming.
